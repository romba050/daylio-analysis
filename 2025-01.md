  Woke up late since I went to bed at 3am. My rythm is messed up and I have little drive, found the sylvester party somewhat disappointing. The new environment after Idesbald means I need to slightly change routines again and since I am seperates on the attic from my parents, it's easy to have my own routine from them that is not as healthy. Went to Joe and Michelle in rue Mies, Mersch in the evening and we played Casconia and Conspiracy (the underwater game). We talked about how I might come back to Luxembourg and to do the "Staatsexamen A1" (for Master and Phd). It gave me a lot to think but I couldn't really come to a conclusion. I feel like Luxembourg is somewhat boring and the police is not as cool as SaaS companies or Science. I thought about what makes me happy on the way back, then I tried to distract myself from these unsolvable questions and I went to bed way too late again, at 2:00

  Mental fear of returning to sweden. But also a excited to see Jessica again. Procrastinated a lot because it felt bad to think off all the things to do and because I went to bed late and was tired. Climbed with JJ and Nicki, which was awesome. Almost flashed 6C on toprope despite being tired, def. possible when fresh and when using good technique.

  went swimming to Akeshov. Made the plan in the morning, told Jessica about it and she insisted I stick to it when I didn't feel like it, so that I maintain my mental health. Of course she was right and after swimming I felt much better. Watched "Love is blind" and had a good laugh.

  First day in Stockholm where I waa on a "work schedule". I started the day by trying to get a psychologist appointment for ADHD assessment. But BrommavÃ¥rd Central's number told me to call back again the next day. I was a bit let down by that, so I googled psychologists and found some private ones I could use. Sveapsykologi have ADD specialists and they say they have an average diagnosis cost of 29000 SEK = 3000 EUR. I am considering doing this. I am also second guessing my relationship again and asking myself if Jessica is the right woman for me since her friends and interests are so different. Maybe this is also something to discuss with a psychologist. I brought it up with Mindler psychologist but the 30min remote sessions were always focussed on helping me formalise CBT and I lost the patience for that.   I often think that I distnace myself from Jessica. She needs to ask me "do you want to play a boardgame together?" "Do you want to play videofames together?". It is not that I wouldn't want to do things together, it's just that my favorite hobbies are not interesting to her (mushroom hunting, sports, hiking, etc). So I don't even ask or I know that if I take her with me, it's will hijack the activity somewhat.   I am very wary that if we were to have children, all of these hobbies of mine would die completly. I already feel pressure to abondon my hobbies to soent more time with her.  I picked up the ceramics, went shopping, we cooked fajitas together and played Rayman. Even though I was reluctant at first, it was fun in the end!

@22:14: 4.0 time together
  Did PRP for hair at NordicHair, went to Tokyo ramen and then to the Swedish Royal Opera to see Sweeney Todd, the demon barber of Fleet Street. Opera was a bit disappointing, 3h with 30min break was hard to sit through, we had limited view because the row before us was the saem height, regretted skimping on tickets. Jessica was also displeased. The singing was ok but I couldn't understand the story oftentime. All in all was cool as a new experience and the building and set pieces where impressive but I wouldn't repeat it especially not at 600 SEK a seat.

  Procrastinated the whome day even thiugh I got up with Jessica like every morning. Told her I would go to KI library to climb, didn't do it because I was first watching a youtube video and was feeling anxious about not sending the perfect application I guess. Then I went down an instagram doomscrolling rabbit hole. When she cam back at 18, I was in the middle of cooling a chili. She was upset/disappointed, I lied and told her I went to KI library instead, she said I need the kitchen, I thought you would be in climbing. I said I can clean the kitchen if you need it, idk when the others go climbing. She shook her head and said I don't want you to come home too late and wake me up. I packed my half cut veggies and left to go climbing with the goal to climb from 19-21, which I did but I talked a lot in the changing rooms and went to sauna and then I took the bus at 22:10 and arrived home at 22:30. Climbing was awesome though, Javier, his gf Lisa, Adrian, Varhan, Stepan, Anja, Javier and Coral where all there. I had engaging conversations and climbed a 6C by using smart breaks, even though I already was c'imbing the day before :)
